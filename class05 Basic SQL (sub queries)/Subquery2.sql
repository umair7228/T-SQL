/*
Execution Steps:

Subquery Execution for Each Customer:
For customer_id = 1: The subquery returns the set {500, 1500}.
For customer_id = 2: The subquery returns the set {200}.
For customer_id = 3: The subquery returns the set {1200, 700}.

ANY Operator Evaluation:
For customer_id = 1: 1000 < ANY ({500, 1500}) is TRUE because 1500 > 1000.
For customer_id = 2: 1000 < ANY ({200}) is FALSE because 200 is not greater than 1000.
For customer_id = 3: 1000 < ANY ({1200, 700}) is TRUE because 1200 > 1000.

Main Query Result:
Customers with customer_id = 1 and customer_id = 3 meet the condition.
